I am a student in Bachelors of Technology with a major in Computer Science. From the second year of my degree I undertook coding challenges and actively participated in program solving in Python , JAVA and also in SQL. I was delighted to be presented with the opportunity to utilize the skills gained during my studies to solve problems in the engineering world. My goal is to get a job in the Information Technology field after graduating. I enjoy solving technical problems, researching and developing new projects on different platforms. I enjoy meeting people and working with them in a team environment. I excel in my ability to work under pressure and handle stressful situations very well. These skills that I have will be a benefit for any information technology company.
